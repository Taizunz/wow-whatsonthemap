# What's On The Map?

Displays a simple list of map vignettes that're currently visible. Or maybe not so visible.

This *cannot* show ore or herbs. Blizzard works very hard to make those inaccessible to addons.

### Configuration

For a summary of settings:
```/wotm```

To toggle whether the frame shows a title (which can be used to drag it around):
```/wotm title```

To toggle whether the frame will show even when there's nothing nearby on the map:
```/wotm empty```

To toggle whether the frame will include items which aren't visible currently (on the minimap or world map):
```/wotm hidden```

To toggle showing a lot of debug information about vignettes that you probably don't care about in the tooltips:
```/wotm debug```
